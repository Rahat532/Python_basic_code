The core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. These principles allow programmers to organize code into "objects," which are self-contained units with their own data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). This approach leads to more modular, reusable, and maintainable software. 
Key OOP concepts
Encapsulation: The bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (a class). It protects the object's internal state from outside interference by hiding the complex details and restricting access.
Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class (subclass) can derive properties and methods from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchy of classes.
Polymorphism: The ability of a single function or method to be used in different ways. For example, the + operator can perform addition with numbers and concatenation with strings. It allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way.
Abstraction: The process of simplifying reality by modeling classes based on relevant attributes and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, making the code simpler and more focused.
Classes and Objects: In OOP, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining the properties and methods that all objects of that type will have. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity from the real world (like a specific "car" object).
